            <h1>Hey there! I'm Catlinman!</h1>
            <p>
                Your radical dreaming humble fishstick and fiendlord known on the
                internet as Catlinman at your service. I prefer being called Cat in
                short but whatever you prefer works! I do pretty much anything and
                everything that has to do with computers ranging from digital art,
                animation and modelling over to programming, game design, web
                development and engineering all the way to making electronic music.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am always open to working and hanging out with people! If you want anything
                from me I'm right there for you! Just hit me up on any of my profiles, pages and
                communities! You can find some extra links in the contact page. There you will
                also find business related contact options.

                As you can see the website is currently being completely rebuilt. This means
                that most functionality is currently missing. Although the main part of the
                site is done in terms of coding I still have to hook up a lot of the sub systems
                before everything is done. Expect this in a week though if I continue at the pace
                that I currently am!
