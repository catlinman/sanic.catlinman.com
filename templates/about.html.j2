        <h1>Hey there! I'm Catlinman!</h1>
        <p>
            Your radical dreaming humble fishstick and fiendlord known on the
            internet as Catlinman at your service. I prefer being called Cat in
            short but whatever you prefer works! I do pretty much anything and
            everything that has to do with computers ranging from digital art,
            animation and modelling over to programming, game design, web
            development and engineering all the way to making electronic music.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am always open to working and hanging out with people! If you want anything
            from me I'm right there for you! Just hit me up on any of my profiles, pages and
            communities! You can find some extra links in the contact page. There you will
            also find business related contact options.
